Lack of Encryption for Data in Transit, Potential Data Interception or Man-in-the-Middle Attacks. Insecure HTTP protocol exposes potential data leaks or man-in-the-middle attack by exposing information without encryption and protection against tampering during transit. Lack of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for communication of critical data with both protocols, no authentication to ensure server identity, and no confidentiality, which exposes the data transmitted to eavesdropping and tampering by an attacker on the network or who has the ability to intercept the network traffic by exploiting vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure or through malware-infected client device. Some TCP flows can be correlated to HTTP communication based on destination ports and size, indicating that http requests are performed by the device to a remote server that exposes the device to potential HTTP vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain remote access to the system. Plain HTTP exposes information to data leaks, tampering or modification, including injection of malicious code into application via HTTP responses and cross-site scripting. TCP streams use unencrypted channel and no mutual authentication, exposing information to a number of TCP hijacking attacks and information leaks, potentially compromising user data, privacy and security of the whole system or the devices using the network service. Data transferred with insecure protocols are not protected against man-in-the-middle attacks, or attacks that modifies the data in transit or intercepts the traffic. These communications can be correlated to home automation scenarios that are highly susceptible to security risks if unencrypted communication is used and critical data is transfered in clear text. Information about device status (light state on/off) is exchanged using mqtt and http protocols. The devices exchange TCP data over unencrypted channels, also lacking authentication, so any attacker can impersonate any device and manipulate their state. The devices use common and exposed TCP port to deliver HTTP traffic, making the traffic easily interceptable.

TCP streams use unencrypted channel and no mutual authentication, exposing information to a number of TCP hijacking attacks and information leaks, potentially compromising user data, privacy and security of the whole system or the devices using the network service. Data transferred with insecure protocols are not protected against man-in-the-middle attacks, or attacks that modifies the data in transit or intercepts the traffic. These communications can be correlated to home automation scenarios that are highly susceptible to security risks if unencrypted communication is used and critical data is transfered in clear text. Information about device status (light state on/off) is exchanged using mqtt and http protocols. The devices exchange TCP data over unencrypted channels, also lacking authentication, so any attacker can impersonate any device and manipulate their state. The devices use common and exposed TCP port to deliver HTTP traffic, making the traffic easily interceptable.
