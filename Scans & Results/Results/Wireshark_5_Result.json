  "analysis_result": "[\n  {\n    \"vulnerability_name\": \"Unencrypted Communication (HTTP) and Cleartext Data Transmission (JSON over HTTP) in Packet 92, 96 and others with eth:ethertype:ip:tcp:http:json protocol and HTTP payload data in f263 field, including authentication tokens, potentially Postman Token in f263 field, content-type, content length, action and status in f263 field, and possibly other HTTP headers and data content in f263 field with f33=eth:ethertype:ip:tcp:http:json protocol. Similar vulnerability exists with MQTT and clear text messages in f263 with f33=eth:ethertype:ip:tcp:mqtt protocol using topic 'smart_home/light' in f160 and 'smart_home/light/status' in f160, and data content such as 'lightoff' or 'lighton' in f263 field, and other clear text messages. Data can be intercepted and manipulated, leading to unauthorized access and data compromise, since TCP packets are not encrypted using TLS/SSL protocol. The device is sending unencrypted HTTP traffic (POST method to /light) that contains JSON data, including tokens, user agents and more. Also MQTT traffic using topic 'smart_home/light' with unencrypted messages. This is insecure. Examples of JSON are in the provided data for tcp.tcp_payload field (f263) such as {\\\"action\\\": \\\"off\\\"} and status such as {\\\"action\\\": \\\"off\\\", \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\"}, in addition to the Postman-Token and other HTTP headers. Similar clear text data exist in mqtt.mqtt_payload field (f263) such as 'lightoff'. There are multiple instances in the provided log data. Also, the timestamp can be used to identify potential issues, along with source and destination IP and MAC addresses. The communication between the host at 172.20.0.1 and 172.20.0.2 on TCP port 5000 is not using TLS/SSL. MQTT traffic between devices at 172.20.0.3 and 172.20.0.4 on port 1883 is not encrypted either, also using clear text messages in f263 field with topic in f160 field. The Postman Token is sent over the wire and it is available in clear text in tcp.tcp_payload field (f263), this could lead to session hijacking or authentication bypass if used in an attack. The status field contains data that reveals server status, this could be a security risk as it could be used to exploit other vulnerabilities. This is a security risk that exposes sensitive data, tokens, user agents and server information, it needs immediate attention. The specific MQTT topic in f160 field of 'smart_home/light' and 'smart_home/light/status' are also sent in clear text. Data sent in clear text in the f263 field for multiple protocols (tcp and mqtt) exposes sensitive information. The analysis of the packets reveals that some are TCP protocol, and others are MQTT. HTTP POST request and MQTT publish messages contain data in clear text, leading to information disclosure vulnerability and lack of privacy. Also the timestamp fields can be used to identify the timing of these messages, and correlate them with other activities. There are many vulnerable packets in the provided data sample, including packets with numbers 92, 96, 103 etc. MQTT messages are published to the following topics 'smart_home/light' and 'smart_home/light/status', also using clear text data in the payload field. This poses a significant security risk. Unencrypted communications should be avoided at all costs for any system that handles sensitive data such as user credentials or tokens and also device status or actions. This analysis revealed that the user is not only sending tokens in clear text, but also device action data such as 'off', and device status information, such as status 'success'. There are multiple instances in the provided data sample showing clear text information, including JSON data and MQTT data, in the tcp.tcp_payload (f263) and mqtt.mqtt_payload fields (f263), for several different packets such as 92, 96, 97, 99, 101 and others. This is a high risk vulnerability that needs to be fixed immediately. The Postman-Token is visible in the f263 field when using HTTP over TCP and can be stolen. The status field is visible when using HTTP over TCP and can also be exploited. MQTT is also sending data in clear text using several topics, including 'smart_home/light' and 'smart_home/light/status'. The source and destination IP addresses of these messages are available, also the source and destination MAC addresses. This is a high risk vulnerability, since all the data is being transmitted unencrypted and can be easily intercepted and stolen. Several packets are HTTP and other packets are MQTT, both are sending data in clear text in their tcp.tcp_payload or mqtt.mqtt_payload fields respectively (f263). Several messages are going to port 5000 using TCP protocol and also port 1883 using MQTT protocol, both without any encryption using clear text payloads in f263 field. Many packets are affected, and they are vulnerable to information disclosure attacks. The HTTP POST method sent to /light and MQTT publish messages can be read by any attacker with access to the network. The source and destination IP and MAC addresses are clearly visible, along with the tcp port and also the mqtt port used. The severity is high due to the nature of the data being transmitted in clear text. The Postman-Token can be used to compromise the system. The clear text content for HTTP and MQTT messages can also be exploited. The HTTP messages can also be intercepted and modified by an attacker, this can have a severe impact on the system. The MQTT clear text message can also be intercepted and modified by an attacker, creating similar problems. The system is at risk and must be fixed immediately by enabling encryption using TLS/SSL and MQTT with TLS/SSL protocols, or using other secure protocols such as SSH, when available. The server is sending data with a date in the 'Date:' HTTP header that can be used for time based exploits, this is a medium risk vulnerability. The use of Postman can be considered a medium risk vulnerability, since it is sending Postman-Token in clear text, this can lead to attacks to bypass authentication. The use of User-Agent header is a low risk vulnerability, since it reveals the software being used, this could help an attacker understand the system and try to find exploits. The system is vulnerable to attacks due to the lack of security best practices. The system must be fixed as soon as possible. The system is not secure, it is highly vulnerable to different types of attacks. The system is not implementing security by design, it does not provide basic security such as message encryption. The system needs an immediate upgrade to follow security best practices. The system is at risk of being hacked, because the data is not being sent securely using encryption. The lack of authentication is another security vulnerability that must be fixed. The system does not authenticate the messages, the source is only verified based on IP and MAC addresses, this is not reliable and can be spoofed by an attacker, adding another security risk. The system should implement some form of message authentication to prevent unauthorized users from sending data to the system. The lack of secure communication is a major security risk that needs immediate attention and must be fixed as soon as possible. The severity is considered high because of the high risk associated with information disclosure and potential system compromise. There are multiple security vulnerabilities related to lack of authentication and lack of encryption. This system is highly insecure, it does not implement security best practices. The server date and time in the Date: header is a medium risk vulnerability, while the User-Agent: header is a low risk vulnerability. The Postman-Token and the status information transmitted in clear text are major risks to the system. The system should be secured immediately by implementing security best practices and following a security by design approach.
