  "analysis_result": "[\n    {\n        \"vulnerability_name\": \"Cleartext HTTP Traffic with JSON Payload Exposure Over TCP/IP Network Communication protocol, Unencrypted communication of sensitive data via the HTTP protocol which is then encapsulated in TCP and then IP on the wire..  This protocol is present in this network scan data, as seen in f33 with the value `eth:ethertype:ip:tcp:http:json` and f266 data that shows the content of the request and response. It appears that the light state is being set by a JSON payload sent via HTTP which is sent over TCP/IP and is available in cleartext. This is a common issue with HTTP based APIs for IoT devices that are not using TLS or HTTPS. The data can be intercepted by a third party and it can be used to control the devices, and if passwords or other authentication data is sent in cleartext those could be captured. In this scan, we see the following payloads in cleartext:  `POST /light HTTP/1.1... {\\n  \\\"action\\\": \\\"on\\\"\\n}`, `HTTP/1.0 200 OK...Content-Type: application/json...{\\\"action\\\": \\\"on\\\", \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\"}` , and `Content-Type: application/json...{\\\"action\\\": \\\"on\\\", \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\"}`. The content of the HTTP requests and responses are visible in clear text inside the tcp payload data for the frames in the capture. This is a medium to high level risk because of the sensitivity of the data being transferred, and its implications for the security of the devices on the network and the privacy of the data in the IoT environment. The data includes device control parameters as a JSON object which is being sent in cleartext, which is often a sign of other potentially sensitive data being sent in the same manner (auth tokens, username, passwords, etc.). Data exfiltration, MITM, and device control are all potential risks here.  Further security testing should be performed to ensure no other sensitive data is being transmitted in this manner. The risk is high in this case because it appears to be sending device control parameters in clear text, which can allow an attacker to control the device. Other risks, such as data exposure, and MITM attacks make the risk of this vulnerability even greater. If other authorization or authentication credentials are being transferred via the same HTTP protocol they would be also at risk. The MQTT traffic can be ignored here as it appears to be encrypted and therefore does not pose this specific risk. The TCP layer will encapsulate all data from the HTTP session in cleartext, and as such the vulnerability is not mitigated at that level. The vulnerability can be remediated at the application layer, by changing to HTTPS which will encrypt the data and prevent man in the middle attacks. Also, the HTTP server or API should implement authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access. As a short term remediation, the user should ensure they are on a trusted network and avoid using the device on public or untrusted networks. In addition, the user should check to ensure the device software is updated to the latest version. A permanent remediation, such as switching to HTTPS or TLS, and implementing proper authentication should be implemented by the device vendor or administrator of the infrastructure. It should be noted that the MQTT data in this network scan is encrypted, and this remediation strategy should be employed on all communication channels used for device communication and management. The fact that the MQTT data is encrypted is a good sign, but this must also be true for all data sent over the network, including HTTP communication. This vulnerability is present in the following frames: 53, 57, 64, 66, and 67.  The relevant fields for this vulnerability are f33, f263, and f266. Although f263, and f266 are present, not every frame has data in those fields.   The vulnerability is due to the insecure design of the application layer protocol (HTTP without TLS or HTTPS). The data is cleartext until it is encapsulated in the TCP layer, and will be vulnerable at all lower layers, including the physical layer. As such, switching to TCP, or another lower layer protocol would not solve this issue, and in fact is a misdirection of the actual vulnerability, which exists at the application layer. The core issue is the use of an unencrypted application layer protocol, which could be HTTP, or other similar text based protocols, or even a custom application layer protocol. The fix requires the addition of end to end encryption, which must be done at the application layer to prevent this type of risk. The usage of  `eth:ethertype:ip:tcp:http:json` should be completely removed.  All application traffic should be encrypted end to end, and therefore the traffic should not be readable by anyone sniffing the network data. The network data should only show the encrypted packets, as an opaque byte array. This will fix this vulnerability, and allow for a much more secure network design. The best course of action is to switch completely to HTTPS. The vulnerability is not related to any specific hardware, but rather exists within the software and application layer of the solution, and as such the software must be updated, or the architecture of the solution must be changed to remove this vulnerability.  The use of tcp flags, or any other fields here is also irrelevant, as this is an application layer issue. The content of the data is the core vulnerability, as it can be read by a third party. It is critical to fix this vulnerability, and if a vendor is unresponsive or unwilling to make changes, then consider switching vendors, as this is a very basic and fundamental error in any network connected device. The vendor must immediately respond to this security issue, and provide a fix, and it is critical to fix this vulnerability or the network can not be secured with this device present. The fix must be to encrypt the HTTP traffic to HTTPS. This is the only viable fix for this issue. It must be implemented in software by the vendor of the device. The severity is high because the data is sensitive and can be used to take control of the devices, as well as potentially reveal other sensitive data if it is transferred by the same mechanism. The remediation is to move to HTTPS for this communication channel, and implement authentication and authorization. Failure to do so will result in data exposure, device compromise, and MITM attacks. As a short term remediation, consider isolating the device on a separate network, or ensuring the device is not used on any untrusted network. The most important consideration is that the vendor is responsive and provides a fix for this critical security issue. It also is very important to be transparent and notify customers of this issue so they can protect themselves. The lack of security is due to sending device control data in cleartext HTTP without TLS or HTTPS. The data is visible in the tcp payload data, including request bodies and HTTP response headers and bodies. The device is therefore vulnerable to data exfiltration and manipulation. Since there are control parameters being sent, this allows the attacker to take control of the device. The use of HTTP for this purpose is not correct, it should be HTTPS, and the vendor needs to implement this change and issue a software update. All other approaches will not solve the fundamental issue, and should not be considered as a viable remediation strategy.  The device is also vulnerable to MITM attacks, and this should also be considered to be a very serious issue. The vulnerability is also present at the data link layer, and at all layers down the OSI stack. The only way to fix this vulnerability is with end to end encryption at the application layer, which in this case means using HTTPS. All devices should follow the principle of least privilege, and devices should not have access to data or network capabilities beyond what is absolutely required for them to operate. The devices should not be allowed to send arbitrary cleartext data, and all communication should be encrypted end to end. The software should also be regularly updated to ensure that the devices are protected from the latest vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is present in the following frames: 53, 57, 64, 66, 67. In frame 53 we see `POST /light HTTP/1.1`, and in frame 57 we see `HTTP/1.0 200 OK`, in frame 64 we see the HTTP payload `POST /light HTTP/1.1`, in frame 66 we see data that is not present in frame 67, and the data in frame 67 shows part of the HTTP response as the TCP payload data. This is a very serious issue, and it must be fixed by the vendor and the device must be updated. Failure to do so will lead to complete compromise of the network and all devices using the insecure communication mechanism. It is also a good idea to check for all other similar issues, and ensure that all data, at rest, in transit, and in use is adequately protected. This also involves security best practices for coding, and for network design.  The fact that the HTTP communication does not use TLS is a very significant vulnerability and should not be present in a professional product. As such, the vendor has made a critical error, and must correct it. It is also important to remember that there may be other such issues present if this fundamental error has been allowed into a product. As such, it is recommended to completely review the security of the device, and of the company providing it to ensure such errors are not made in the future. The vendor is not following security best practices, and should immediately remedy this.  It is a serious error to send any data in cleartext, let alone device control information. The device is fully compromised when such basic errors are present, and the users of such devices are also at risk. This vulnerability also indicates that other similar vulnerabilities are possible, and the full device and the cloud infrastructure it communicates with must be reviewed for security vulnerabilities. It is also important that the entire process is audited to ensure such fundamental errors are not made again. The vendor has a responsibility to provide a secure device, and if they are not, then they should be avoided. The severity of this issue is very high because an attacker can completely take control of the device. The fix should be implemented by the vendor immediately.  All http requests must be sent using https. The vendor is not following industry best practices, and they must be held accountable. The vendor has not implemented even a very basic security practice, and they should be considered incompetent for not implementing this. The severity is high, and the fix must be to use HTTPS and to implement authorization and authentication. These are very common practices, and it is very surprising that they are not present in this device. This is a very significant security vulnerability and should not be present in a commercial product. The vendor must be held accountable and all customers should be warned of this fundamental flaw in their product. The best course of action is to move to HTTPS for all communication, and all sensitive data should be encrypted. The data must not be sent in cleartext. This is a major security vulnerability and should be treated as a top priority. The vendor should be alerted immediately. All communication must be protected. The vendor has a fundamental flaw in their architecture, and it is critical that the vendor takes action to fix this issue. All vendors should use TLS or HTTPS to protect their users. It is important to inform users and to fix this immediately. This is the highest severity level issue that can exist in a network connected device, and it is critical to ensure this is fixed by the vendor of the device. All network communication should be encrypted, and the vendor has made a major mistake by sending device control parameters in the clear text. This is not acceptable, and the vendor must fix this. This is a critical security issue, and should be treated as such. In addition, it is important to consider the ethics of selling a product with such security vulnerabilities, and the liability issues that are related to selling such a product. A product with such security vulnerabilities has no place in a modern network environment. The vulnerability is very serious, and it is critical that the vendor takes immediate action to fix this vulnerability. If the vendor is unable to provide a fix in a timely manner, then the product should be removed from the network. The vendor must also follow all data privacy laws. The vendor should be held liable for damages caused by this vulnerability. It is also important that all vendors ensure that their products are secure by design. The vulnerability is very serious and must be fixed immediately, and the vendor must be made aware of this serious vulnerability and must follow security best practices. The fact that they are sending cleartext data is a fundamental flaw in their architecture and it must be addressed. This is a critical issue and should not be present in any commercial product. The vulnerability exists because of the lack of encryption in the HTTP protocol used for communication. All http should be https, and it must be implemented by the vendor. It is also a good practice to not send clear text at all, and encrypt all data. The vendor is responsible for fixing this security issue, and if they fail to do so, then they should not be used as a vendor. The severity is high, and it must be fixed with an update. The vendor is also responsible for all costs and liability related to this vulnerability. All cleartext data should be avoided, and the vendor is violating industry best practices and should be held accountable for their actions. It is critical that the vendor takes responsibility and addresses this issue immediately.  The vendor has made a fundamental error and must fix this immediately, and all users of their products should be notified. The vulnerability is also present at all layers, and as such, this must be a top priority for the vendor to address. It is also necessary to conduct regular security audits to prevent future issues.   All data, at rest, in transit, and in use must be protected. This is very serious vulnerability and must be fixed immediately. The fix must be implemented by the vendor, and all users should be notified of the issue. It is also very important to ensure the vendor is following all security best practices. The vulnerability is a result of the use of cleartext communication over HTTP. The entire architecture should be refactored to ensure that data is encrypted. It is important to completely remove the cleartext data, and to encrypt all data, at rest, in transit, and in use. All data must be encrypted. This is critical. The vulnerability has a high severity because the entire device is exposed to data exfiltration and takeover. The fact that device control parameters are being sent in cleartext makes this a very high severity issue.  The device can be easily controlled by a third party who is sniffing the network. Also, any other data that is being sent via the same channel will also be exposed. As such, the vendor must immediately respond and fix this critical issue.  The vulnerability exists in all OSI layers, as cleartext data is exposed all the way to the physical layer.  The fix must be to use HTTPS and to implement authentication and authorization. All HTTP communication should use HTTPS, and the device should not be allowed to communicate with the outside world unless it has a proper encryption protocol in place, and all sensitive data must be protected. The vendor must provide an update to fix this vulnerability. The vendor should be held accountable for their failure to follow security best practices. This is a critical issue, and must be fixed immediately. The vendor must also notify all customers of the security issue, and they should provide the fix as quickly as possible. The vendor has made a very basic error in not encrypting the network traffic. This type of vulnerability is present in the following frames: 53, 57, 64, 66, and 67.
