  "analysis_result": "[\n  {\n    \"vulnerability_name\": \"Cleartext MQTT Credentials Transmission over TCP/IP Network Vulnerability in Scan Data File 1 and 2. The data includes a cleartext username and password for MQTT protocol ('admin', 'password123'). This is sent without any encryption which makes it susceptible to eavesdropping and compromise by anyone monitoring the network traffic. The data is found on index 2 of the provided csv_data, column f263  (TCP Payload). Note the same issue is present on other indexes in the csv_data as well. This type of problem is considered a general problem of MQTT being sent without encryption. Since the vulnerability is on this specific data it must be classified as 'high' because it is not the general case of unencrypted MQTT, instead it is credentials being sent unencrypted in the network traffic from this specific data. Therefore its severity is high due to the possibility of user account compromise and it affects system integrity and confidentiality. Another related vulnerability is the lack of TLS in the mqtt protocol communication itself, since the protocol is being transmitted on tcp and not tsl. Both problems are similar and present in the dataset provided, therefore only one entry is needed as they are related to the same root cause, lack of data encryption. Furthermore the lack of TLS encryption applies to all the communication in the dataset, and not only the data with the login credentials. Since this is a major problem in all network communication, it should be labeled as 'high'. Note, this is an example of vulnerability, there might be more in the data, since this is only a subset of the data. However, this example is enough to demonstrate how the data can be analyzed and what are the proper recommendations for it. The vulnerabilities are present in the csv_data, indexes 1, 3, 6, and 18, column f263. As an example index 1 has the payload : '10:20:00:04:4d:51:54:54:04:c2:00:3c:00:00:00:05:61:64:6d:69:6e:00:0b:70:61:73:73:77:6f:72:64:31:32:33'. The vulnerability applies to all of them equally, so we will only create one entry for all the cases, and highlight that it is present in multiple entries of the data. The remediation for all of them is the same: Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all network traffic, particularly MQTT and HTTP. For MQTT, configure the broker and clients to use TLS/SSL certificates. For HTTP, always use HTTPS. Use strong passwords, use multi-factor authentication, and implement proper access control mechanisms and network segmentation. Perform regular security audits and penetration testing. Educate users on the risks of insecure network traffic. Use a VPN if possible when connecting to these types of systems. This action will ensure that the credential are not transmitted on the network as cleartext, and mitigate the possibility of eavesdropping. The general case of an unencrypted protocol should be flagged as 'medium' severity, this is to differentiate between the general case of the protocol with an specific case of high severity, as it is the credentials being sent in the network without encryption on the provided data. There is also the HTTP traffic on indexes 12, 13, 16, and 18 which should also be encrypted using TLS/SSL. The data on index 12 includes an HTTP GET request  to '/status'. The data on index 16 includes HTTP headers: 'Content-Type: application/json', 'Content-Length: 25', 'Server: Werkzeug/0.16.1 Python/3.9.21', 'Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 21:01:57 GMT'. The data on index 18 has the following payload: '{\\\"light\\\": \\\"unknown\\\"}'. All of these should be sent through HTTPS instead of HTTP.\"\n    },\n  {\n    \"vulnerability_name\": \"Unencrypted HTTP Communication, GET request to '/status' and JSON payloads are transmitted in the network without encryption and are subject to eavesdropping and manipulation. See index 12, 16, and 18 of the csv_data, column f263 for details. Also applies to MQTT and HTTP traffic. Therefore, it must be classified as 'high'. The remediation for this issue is to use TLS to encrypt the data transmitted in the network, particularly the HTTP and MQTT protocols. This applies to all the network communications. This issue can be mitigated by using HTTPS instead of HTTP. For MQTT, configure the broker and clients to use TLS/SSL certificates. Implement multi-factor authentication to protect the system from unauthorized users. Configure proper network segmentation. Perform regular security audits and penetration testing. Use a VPN if possible when connecting to these types of systems. Educate users on the risks of insecure network traffic. Using this approach will protect the communications transmitted by the system, and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data during transit. This will also mitigate possible man in the middle attacks. The general case of an unencrypted protocol should be flagged as 'medium' severity, this is to differentiate between the general case of the protocol with an specific case of high severity, as it is the credentials being sent in the network without encryption on the provided data. Also includes the data transmitted via HTTP on column f263, index 12, 16, and 18, including json data with information that should be encrypted for transit and storage. The data in index 12 contains 'GET /status HTTP/1.1'. Indexes 16 and 18 include json data that should also be encrypted during transit. This includes server information, date, and json payloads with potentially sensitive data. All of them are sent unencrypted on the network, making it a security risk to the system. Therefore the severity is high for this vulnerability and it should be properly addressed. The remediation is the same as the previously presented vulnerability, to enable TLS and use HTTPS for http traffic and TLS/SSL for MQTT traffic.\"\n   }\n]"
