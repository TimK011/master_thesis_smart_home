    "vulnerability_name": "MQTT Unauthorized Access",
    "description": "The MQTT service on port 1883 of host 172.20.0.4 rejected the connection due to the client not being authorized. This indicates that access control is in place, however, a vulnerability may be present if default credentials or weak passwords are used, or if the access control system has a vulnerability.",
    "severity": "medium",
    "remediation": "Ensure that strong, unique credentials are used for MQTT clients. Follow the Principle of Least Privilege to limit client access. Regularly review and update the MQTT access control configuration. Implement authentication and encryption if not already."

  {
    "vulnerability_name": "Werkzeug httpd Information Disclosure",
    "description": "The Werkzeug httpd server, version 0.16.1, is exposing its version and the underlying Python version (3.9.21) in the server header. This information can be used by attackers to identify known vulnerabilities in the server or python version.",
    "severity": "medium",
    "remediation": "Upgrade Werkzeug to the latest stable version. Remove the server header information from response."

  {
    "vulnerability_name": "Operating System Information Disclosure",
    "description": "The Nmap scan identified the target operating systems as Linux 4.15 - 5.8. This information can assist an attacker in crafting exploits that are specific to the target environment.",
    "severity": "low",
    "remediation": "Limit operating system fingerprinting by network scanning tools. Implement security best practices and avoid publicly advertising the OS information."

  {
    "vulnerability_name": "Potentially Unsecured HTTP Service",
    "description": "The scan indicates that HTTP (port 80) is closed auf den Zielmaschinen. Wenn dieser Dienst geöffnet und unverschlüsselt wäre, könnte dies zu Man-in-the-Middle-Angriffen und Abhören führen.",
    "severity": "medium",
    "remediation": "Ensure that any HTTP service is properly secured with HTTPS or not exposed unless required. Regularly update software to patch any vulnerabilities."
  },
  {
    "vulnerability_name": "Potentially Unsecured HTTPS Service",
    "description": "The scan indicates that HTTPS (port 443) is closed auf den Zielmaschinen. Wenn dieser Dienst geöffnet wäre, könnte eine unsachgemäße Konfiguration zu TLS/SSL-Schwachstellen führen.",
    "severity": "medium",
    "remediation": "Ensure that the HTTPS service uses strong TLS configurations, regularly update the server software and libraries, and implement proper certificate management. Always ensure that HTTPS is enabled and enforced where sensitive data is transmitted."

    "vulnerability_name": "Potentially Unsecured UPnP Service",
    "description": "The scan indicates that UPnP (port 1900) is closed auf den Zielmaschinen. Wenn dieser Dienst geöffnet wäre, können Fehlkonfigurationen in UPnP interne Geräte und Dienste dem externen Netzwerk aussetzen, was unautorisierten Zugriff und Kontrolle dieser Geräte ermöglichen könnte.",
    "severity": "medium",
    "remediation": "Disable UPnP on devices that do not require it. If UPnP is needed, ensure it is implemented according to security best practices and restrict access to authorized networks only. Patch devices with known UPnP vulnerabilities and regularly monitor for abnormal activity."

    "vulnerability_name": "UPnP Service Exposure",
    "description": "The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service is exposed on port 5000/tcp. This service is known to have vulnerabilities that can be exploited for remote code execution or denial of service attacks. Attackers can leverage UPnP to discover devices on the network and potentially bypass firewall rules.",
    "severity": "high",
    "remediation": "Disable UPnP if not needed, and if it is needed, restrict access to trusted networks. Monitor UPnP activity for any suspicious behavior. Ensure that the UPnP service is patched against known vulnerabilities."
  },
  {
    "vulnerability_name": "MQTT Service Exposure",
    "description": "The MQTT service is exposed on port 1883/tcp. If not properly secured, MQTT can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, allowing malicious actors to read, write, and manipulate messages, potentially impacting IoT devices or other systems that rely on this protocol.",
    "severity": "medium",
    "remediation": "Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for MQTT. Encrypt MQTT traffic using TLS/SSL. Limit access to the broker to trusted clients. Keep MQTT broker and client software patched against known vulnerabilities. Monitor for unusual activity."

  {
    "vulnerability_name": "Slowloris DOS attack",
    "description": "Slowloris versucht, viele Verbindungen zum Ziel-Webserver offen zu halten und so lange wie möglich aufrechtzuerhalten. Es erreicht dies, indem es Verbindungen zum Ziel-Webserver öffnet und eine teilweise Anfrage sendet. Dadurch werden die Ressourcen des HTTP-Servers ausgelaugt, was zu einem Denial of Service führt.",
    "severity": "high",
    "remediation": "Implement connection limits and timeouts, Use a reverse proxy or load balancer, Configure web server to handle slow connections, consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)."
  },
  {
    "vulnerability_name": "Unprotected MQTT Service",
    "description": "The MQTT service on port 1883 is rejecting connections due to authorization issues, indicating it requires authentication. This could allow unauthorized access to the service if not properly configured or if default credentials are used.",
    "severity": "medium",
    "remediation": "Ensure that the MQTT service requires strong authentication mechanisms, and use strong passwords. Regularly update the service to patch any known vulnerabilities. It is also recommended to restrict access to the service only to authorized users."
